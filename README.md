This is the basic documentation for this One Day Build
-> The first step will be to get some nice A-Frame content
This will largely serve as our background for the actual app content, but at times it will do things like playback equrectangular video
Special thanks to Ada Rose Edwards for making the Vaporwave Example which our default background will fork from
Search for it on Glitch.

-> The next step will be to overlay simple primitive UI on top of A-Frame so that it only functions as a background
There are two ways to display content here, one would be to actually use the A-Frame environment to display things as A-images
The other would be to just overlay static text content from another DOM manipulator on top of it
Either way we'll probably start by just using Bootstrap normally and modifying it to rest on top of A-Frame, the rest relies on how interactive it turns out to be.
